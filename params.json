{"name":"Opensim","tagline":"Custom OpenSim ","body":"Welcome to OpenSim!\r\n\r\n#Custom Changes\r\nThis Branch of OpenSim Contains Extended Ossl Functions and other changes\r\n\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\n\r\nOpenSim is a BSD Licensed Open Source project to develop a functioning\r\nvirtual worlds server platform capable of supporting multiple clients\r\nand servers in a heterogeneous grid structure. OpenSim is written in\r\nC#, and can run under Mono or the Microsoft .NET runtimes.\r\n\r\nThis is considered an alpha release.  Some stuff works, a lot doesn't.\r\nIf it breaks, you get to keep *both* pieces.\r\n\r\n# Compiling OpenSim\r\n\r\nPlease see BUILDING.md if you downloaded a source distribution and \r\nneed to build OpenSim before running it.\r\n\r\n# Running OpenSim on Windows\r\n\r\nYou will need .NET 4.0 installed to run OpenSimulator.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you run OpenSim from a command prompt on Windows in order\r\nto capture any errors.\r\n\r\nTo run OpenSim from a command prompt\r\n\r\n * cd to the bin/ directory where you unpacked OpenSim\r\n * run OpenSim.exe\r\n\r\nNow see the \"Configuring OpenSim\" section\r\n\r\n# Running OpenSim on Linux\r\n\r\nYou will need Mono >= 2.10.8.1 to run OpenSimulator.  On some Linux distributions you\r\nmay need to install additional packages.  See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Dependencies\r\nfor more information.\r\n\r\nTo run OpenSim, from the unpacked distribution type:\r\n\r\n * cd bin\r\n * mono OpenSim.exe\r\n\r\nNow see the \"Configuring OpenSim\" section\r\n\r\n# Configuring OpenSim\r\n\r\nWhen OpenSim starts for the first time, you will be prompted with a\r\nseries of questions that look something like:\r\n\r\n\t[09-17 03:54:40] DEFAULT REGION CONFIG: Simulator Name [OpenSim Test]:\r\n\r\nFor all the options except simulator name, you can safely hit enter to accept\r\nthe default if you want to connect using a client on the same machine or over\r\nyour local network.\r\n\r\nYou will then be asked \"Do you wish to join an existing estate?\".  If you're\r\nstarting OpenSim for the first time then answer no (which is the default) and\r\nprovide an estate name.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, you will then be asked to enter an estate owner first name,\r\nlast name, password and e-mail (which can be left blank).  Do not forget these\r\ndetails, since initially only this account will be able to manage your region\r\nin-world.  You can also use these details to perform your first login.\r\n\r\nOnce you are presented with a prompt that looks like:\r\n\r\n\tRegion (My region name) #\r\n\r\nYou have successfully started OpenSim.\r\n\r\nIf you want to create another user account to login rather than the estate\r\naccount, then type \"create user\" on the OpenSim console and follow the prompts.\r\n\r\nHelpful resources:\r\n * http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Configuration\r\n * http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Configuring_Regions\r\n\r\n# Connecting to your OpenSim\r\n\r\nBy default your sim will be available for login on port 9000.  You can login by\r\nadding -loginuri http://127.0.0.1:9000 to the command that starts Second Life\r\n(e.g. in the Target: box of the client icon properties on Windows).  You can\r\nalso login using the network IP address of the machine running OpenSim (e.g.\r\nhttp://192.168.1.2:9000)\r\n\r\nTo login, use the avatar details that you gave for your estate ownership or the\r\none you set up using the \"create user\" command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# More Information on OpenSim\r\n\r\nMore extensive information on building, running, and configuring\r\nOpenSim, and participate in the OpenSim\r\nproject can always be found at http://opensimulator.org.\r\n\r\nThanks for trying OpenSim, we hope it is a pleasant experience.\r\n\r\n#ChangeLog\r\nAdded: osEncodeSHA256  (Threat level None)\r\n\r\nAdded: osDecodeSHA256  (Threat level None)\r\n\r\nAdded: osDerezObject   (Threat level high)\r\n   \r\nAdded: osRandomOrg     (Threat level None)\r\n\r\nAdded: MessageUrl \r\n\r\n#ChangeLog How to use\r\n\r\nstring osEncodeSHA256(\"text to encrypt\",\"password\")\r\n\r\nstring osDecodeSHA256(\"encoded text\",\"password\")\r\n\r\ninteger osRandomOrg(min,max)\r\n\r\nMessageUrl is used to generate the welcome message from a web script\r\nIf MessageUrl is enabled and set then this will override the WelcomeMessage option in the ini\r\nNote changing the welcome message text in the ini or the webserver no longer requires you to reset \r\nopensim/robust as it looks it up on every login. change between MessageUrl and WelcomeMessage \r\nRequires restarting\r\n\t\r\nIf you add <USERNAME> anywhere anywhere in the welcome message in the ini or webserver it will replace it ;with the first and last name of the user logging in\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
